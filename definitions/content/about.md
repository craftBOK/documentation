CraftBOK is an attempt to create a community-curated and accessible body of knowledge of practices and principles related to software craft. 

We do not claim to know every practice or principle and we do not claim that our descriptions of practices/principles are the definitive descriptions.

We do think that something as big as this project can only be handled by a community. That is why we see CraftBOK as a project by the community for the community.
